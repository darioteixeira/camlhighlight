1. Overview
===========

Camlhighlight provides syntax highlighting and pretty-printing facilities
for displaying code samples in Ocsigen applications. The library works by
interfacing with the library portion of GNU Source-highlight [1], a popular
application supporting the most common programming and markup languages.


2. Dependencies
===============

On the OCaml side, Camlhighlight depends on Sexplib, ppx_sexp_conv, and Tyxml
[2,3,4].  Tyxml is required because Camlhighlight provides functions that
output valid Html values using Tyxml's Html module, whereas Sexplib is used
for parsing and to provide serialisation facilities.

Camlhighlight requires also GNU Source-highlight, of course.  Note that for
many Linux distributions you may need to manually download and build the
source-code for GNU Source-highlight.  There are however some distros that
already package the library's runtime and development versions.


3. Building and installing
==========================

The build system relies on OASIS.  The customary sequence of './configure',
'make', and 'make install' is used to build and install the library.  Run
'make doc' to generate the API documentation.

You will also need to manually copy the file 'data/sexp.outlang' into
GNU Source-highlight's data directory (normally '/usr/share/source-highlight').


4. License
